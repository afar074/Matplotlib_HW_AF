Summary of observations in data


In summary, the average number of metastatic sites was nearly 1.75 sites lower than the placebo and Ketapril drugs. The capomulin drug had significantly higher survival rates over the course of the 45 days. They were the only test group with a final survival rate of over 50% and a survival rate 37.5% higher than any other group. 

The Ketapril has a slower average increase in metastatic sites than the Placebo drug during the course of the 45 days, but overall the number of metatastic sites were about the same. Ketapril's surival rates are comparable to the placebo at the end of the 45 day treatment.

The average Infubinal effect on tumor growth was similar to that of the placebo, but the average increase on the metastatic sites was lower over the course of treatment.

Overall, treatment with Capomulin exhibited a decrease in tumor size, slower spread of metastatic sites and slower decrease in survival rates in comparison to the Infubinol, Ketapril, and the placebo. It was the only treatment out of the 4 reported that saw average tumor size consistently decrease over the 45 day treatment and average tumor size decrease overall.
